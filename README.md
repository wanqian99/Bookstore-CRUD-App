Uol Databases and Advanced Data Techniques CM3010 Midterm

This is a social networking application created with Python and Django, that allows user creation, authentication, adding of friends and real-time chat.
My sns app is called UBook, an app that allows users to socialize and keep their friends updated. It is a responsive site whereby the navigation bar and 
the contents resize according to the deviceâ€™s size. The styling of the application is done with bootstrap4, with the addition of my own custom styles as 
well. A detailed explanation can be found at "report/AWD_Final_Report.pdf".

### How to run the application:
1) Create the Database: node create_db.js
2) Connect to the database, Create Cables and Populate them with CSV data: node populate_db.js
3) Run web app: node index.js
4) Url: http://127.0.0.1:8088/
